## Method

This project explores the concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Deep RL is merely RL using deep neural networks.
These concepts are used to teach a (simulated) quadrotor drone how to successfully complete a flying task.

Two different types of RL algorithms were explored: Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).
